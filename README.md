# THIS IS AN ONLY FRONT-END E-SHOP PROJECT (My first Project)

## Its builded with basic javascript,html and basic css    

It fetches an API from a self-made JSON file of the products to render them
### Each Product contains:
- an image
- name
- price
- the category of the product
- the sub-category
- the type: on-sale or best-seller
- different colors with diferent names and image
- previus price (if its on sale)

### It has a navbar for searching based on category, sub-category, on-sale, best-selllers
and also a search bar

### You can put products as Favorites 
witch you can spectate them in another page

### Products are added from the main or the 'favorites' page to the cart
where the yare displaid with their price plus taxes and a total price of the cart

### after the cart the producta are added to the 'orders' page
where it says what your orders are,the date the order was made and the delivery date
